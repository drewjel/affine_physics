# Roadmap for Peirce 2021

- Derived quantities, including velocity and acceleration
- Functions that give physical quantities as functions of time
- Expose phys API fully through annotation system (don't hide power)
- VSCode IDE integration (get funding to pay for this)
- Select code representations of domain constructs, provide interpretations for them
