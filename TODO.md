TODO:

Do the same stuff for expressions that we just did for vector instances.

Implement domain.isConsistent. This means iterating over the domain objects and writing out a corresponding Lean file and sending it off to the type checker.

Hannah's Todo

* get the literal name of each of the vector instance.


DONE:

~~Connect "ASTNode" object to the Clang AST node objects that you're
finding in the code.~~

~~Update the oracle so that it asks you about which spaces vectors belong to.~~

~~Update readme file.~~

~~Update .gitignore so that we don't push binaries.~~

~~Add a method to the domain to provide the list of available spaces.~~
