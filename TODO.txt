TODO:

Update .gitignore so that we don't push binaries.

Connect "ASTNode" object to the Clang AST node objects that you're
finding in the code.

Update the oracle so that it asks you about which spaces vectors belong to. 

DONE:

To do this, the oracle will need to obtain a list of spaces from the domain.
Add a method to the domain to provide the list of available spaces.
