## Overview

This directory contains a version of math and phys in which physical spaces are extensions of standard affine spaces equipped with affine operations on physical quantities, e.g., points and durations in time.

## Issues
- No algebra of transformations
- No derived dimension algebra 
- No direct summing of spaces
- No barycentric combinations
