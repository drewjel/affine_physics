# The Playground ROS Test project

This project is meant to support rapid "playing around" with ROS files and Peirce analysis. You can add C++ Ros program files in src/playground/src then update the build files to build them, and thereafter use Peirce to analyze them. The files currently in this project include

1. transforms.cpp. This program demonstrates the creations of transforms and their application to several objects.
